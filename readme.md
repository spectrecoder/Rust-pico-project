# Super Blank Pico Project

Super blank template for getting started programming Rust on your
Raspberry Pi Pico.

## Steps
1. clone this project
2. navigate into the cloned project directory with terminal
3. run 'cargo run --bin blinky' to build and flash the blinky example written
by the rp-rs team.
4. you should see the onboard LED flashing on your Pico

## Notes
I made this project for myself for quick new-project start up, but also for future Rustaceans who are interested in taking the Raspberry Pi Pico for a test drive.

It took me around 2 hours to go from unboxing my pico to flashing
the LED.  Granted I didn't know Rust or anything about microcontrollers
when I opened the box, but if I would have had this project I would
have used it as a starting point.
